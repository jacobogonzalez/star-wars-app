"Star Wars Explorer" is a Single-Page Application (SPA) designed to immerse Star Wars fans in the vast universe of the franchise. Utilizing the public Star Wars API (SWAPI), the application allows users to intuitively and responsively explore two key domains: "People" and "Planets."

With a clear and accessible user interface, the application offers browsing, searching (case-insensitive and partial by name), sorting (by name and creation date, ascending or descending), and pagination functionalities (10 items per page). Consistent design is ensured through the use of Vuetify, adapting to different screen sizes with tables on desktop and cards on mobile devices.

The primary goal is to provide an efficient and enjoyable tool for quickly discovering interesting facts about the galaxy, ensuring a smooth user experience with clear loading, error, and empty states, as well as basic accessibility support.
